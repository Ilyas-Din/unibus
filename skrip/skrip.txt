--Introduction--

1. just read the brosure


--Objective--

1. enhance campus life using GPS tracking system by Arduino
	- improving the existing technology
	- adding new feature (real-time location)

2. optimize transportation efficiency
	- allow user (student) to manage their time properly


--Problem Statement--

1. no real-time location provided = can't plan their time wisely

2. safety concerns
	- the location can't be exactly located = the rescue team can't save it immidiately


--Solution--

1. Muiz bgtau cara arduino berfungsi
2. Iqbal bgtau cara apps berfungsi


--Impact--

1. students can make a decision between waiting the bus or using other public transportation

2. students can plan their time wisely if the are knowing the location of their 
   university's busses

3. improving productivity for student in their study


--Commercialisation--


1. potential to cooperate with any telecommunication companies to provide the SIM 
card for each model.



--Conclusion--

1. with this product, user will concerned about the importance in managing their time wisely
